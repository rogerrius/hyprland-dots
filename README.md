# rogerrius's Hyprland dotfiles

This repository contains my custom configuration files for Hyprland, along with other useful programs. 
Some comments on the code are in catalan, but if you are here I'll suppose that you know what you are doing.

## Overview

These configuration files are designed to create a lightweight and customizable Wayland environment. Some of the programs used:

- Hyprland: Tiling window manager for Wayland with dynamic layouts and keybindings.
- Waybar: Status bar that displays system information such as time, network status, and workspaces.
- Dunst: Notification daemon with personalized themes for a minimal look.
- Rofi: Application launcher and window switcher with a custom theme.
- Zsh: Used along with Oh My Zsh. Shell configuration with useful aliases and plugins, optimized for performance and usability.
