# hyprland-dots
This repository contains my custom configuration files for Hyprland, including integrations with Waybar, Dunst, and Zsh. These settings are optimized for a personalized and efficient workflow in a Wayland environment. There are some catalan comments on the code, but if you know how things work you don't need to translate them.
